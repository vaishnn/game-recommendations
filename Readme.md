# Steam Game Recommender

An application designed to generate personalized game recommendations based on a user's Steam library. This tool allows users to select reference games, adjust their individual influence, and configure discovery preferences to identify new titles.

The project utilizes a Python-based backend to serve as a secure proxy for all Steam API requests, thereby protecting the user's API key, while the frontend provides a clean and modern user interface.

## Features

- **Steam Library Integration:** Retrieves a user's complete game library via their 17-digit SteamID64.
- **Interactive Game Selection:** Search and select multiple games from your library to serve as a basis for recommendations.
- **Advanced Recommendation Tuning:**
  - Adjust the influence of each selected game (0% to 200%).
  - Option to generate recommendations for titles that are thematically opposite to a selected game.
- **Secure API Handling:** Python Flask server securely manages all communications with the Steam Web API, ensuring your API key is never exposed on the client-side.
- **Modern User Interface:** Responsive, two-panel layout with a color palette inspired by the Steam platform.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
steam-game-recommender/
├── .env                # Stores the secret Steam API key
├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
├── server.py           # Flask API proxy server
└── frontend/
    ├── index.html          # Main HTML structure
    ├── script.js           # Client-side logic and event handling
    └── style.css           # User interface styling
```

## Required Data Files

For the recommender system to function, ensure the following files are present in the base directory:

- `cosine_sim.pkl`
- `dataframe.pkl`
- `id_to_index.pkl`

These files are essential for generating game recommendations. If they are missing, the backend will not be able to process recommendation requests. These files are generated by the machine learning model code that can be foundcin the master branch

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following software is installed:

- **Python 3.8+** ([Download](https://www.python.org/))
- **pip** (Python Package Installer, typically included with Python)
- **Steam Web API Key** ([Get yours](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey))

## Setup and Installation

Follow these instructions to configure and install the project on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/steam-game-recommender.git
cd steam-game-recommender
```

### 2. Configure the Backend

#### a. Navigate to the backend directory

```sh
cd backend
```

#### b. (Recommended) Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

**Windows:**
```sh
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### c. Install Dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### d. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the base directory and add your Steam API key:

```
STEAM_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual 32-character key.

## Running the Application

### 1. Start the Backend Server

- Ensure your terminal's working directory is base
- Activate your virtual environment (if applicable).
- Run the Flask server:

```sh
python server.py
```

The server will start and listen on [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000).

> **Note:** Keep this terminal window open while using the application.

### 2. Launch the Frontend Application

- Navigate to the `frontend` directory using your file explorer.
- Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.

The application is now operational and ready for use.

## System Architecture

This application employs a client-server architecture for security and modularity:

1. **Client (Frontend):** User interacts with the web interface. Requests for the game library are sent to the local Python backend, not directly to the Steam API.
2. **Server (Backend):** Flask server receives requests, retrieves the Steam API key from `.env`, and constructs requests to the official Steam Web API.
3. **Steam Web API:** Steam processes the request and returns the user's game library data to the backend server.
4. **Server → Client:** Backend forwards the Steam API response to the client.
5. **Client (Frontend):** JavaScript parses the data and populates the UI.

This proxy pattern is a critical security measure that prevents exposure of the API key on the client-side.
